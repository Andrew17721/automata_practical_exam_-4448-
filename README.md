Section Number : 2

Task being solved : - program that implement function that takes a regular expression as input and converts it into a DFA. Then simulate the DFA on a list of input strings
                    - program that simulates a PDA to check if a string is accepted by a given context-free language (Palindrome (Odd Length))
                    - program to simulate a Turing Machine that recognizes the language L = { 0ⁿ1ⁿ0ⁿ1ⁿ }

how to run : - open terminal then write: python '.\RE to DFA.py'
             - open terminal then write: python .\PDA.py
             - open terminal then write: python '.\Turing machine.py'
